    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Duck à l'orange is a classic French dish that deserves a comeback. It is traditionally made with a whole roasted duck, but my recipe uses duck breasts for faster cooking. It has the same rich, sweet, and tangy flavor.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (8-ounce) duck breast halves</li>
        <li>salt for seasoning</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sherry vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Seville orange marmalade, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons finely grated orange zest plus long strips for garnish</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon reserved duck fat</li>
        <li>teaspoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Score duck skin almost all the way through the skin and fat each way on the diagonal in a crosshatch pattern. Generously season with salt and rub salt into each breast. Let rest, skin-side up, at room temperature, for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk chicken broth, orange liqueur, sherry vinegar, orange marmalade, orange zest, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Pat duck breasts dry with paper towels. Re-season skin-side of duck breasts with salt.</li>
        <li>Heat duck fat in a heavy skillet over medium heat for 2 minutes. Place duck, skin side down, in the skillet and cook until fat renders and skin is crisp, about 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip duck breasts and cook until they start to firm and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 4 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Transfer breasts to a plate to rest. Pour any rendered duck fat into a glass jar.</li>
        <li>Return skillet to medium heat and whisk flour into pan; cook and stir until flour is completely incorporated, about 1 minute. Pour orange mixture into skillet; bring to a boil. Cook until sauce thickens and is reduced, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low. When orange mixture stops bubbling, add butter; stir until butter is completely melted and incorporated into the sauce, about 1 minute. Season with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Slice duck breasts across the grain, arrange on a plate, and spoon orange sauce over the top. Garnish with thin strips of orange zest.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy.</li>
