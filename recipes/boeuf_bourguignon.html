    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This beef bourguignon recipe can be served over rice or noodles.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil/li>
        <li>5 onions, sliced</li>
        <li>2 pounds lean beef, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup dry red wine, or more as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup beef broth, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions in hot oil until tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir beef in the same skillet until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Sprinkle flour, marjoram, thyme, and pepper over beef. Pour red wine and beef broth into the skillet; stir well. Reduce heat to low and simmer until beef is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Add more wine and broth as needed, in a 2:1 ratio, to keep beef barely submerged throughout the cooking time.</li>
        <li>Stir onions and mushrooms into the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender and sauce is thick and dark brown, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
